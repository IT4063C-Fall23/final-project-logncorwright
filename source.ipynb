    "How informed public health campaigns can affect the overall outcome of a pandemic or similar outbreak when it comes to receiving vaccination and proper care for said ailment. In my instances people can be ill informed about vaccinations or other forms of treatment for illnesses and have an adverse outlook of them when in reality they are often times just ill-equiped to make a proper judgement due to not having equal access to the information at hand to make their own informed decision.\n",

    "How have COVID-19 vaccination rates and the availability of vaccine doses evolved over time in various regions?\n",

    "What is the relationship between vaccination rates and the incidence of COVID-19 cases in different demographic groups?\n",
