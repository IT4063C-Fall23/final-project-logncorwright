    "How informed public health campaigns can affect the overall outcome of a pandemic or similar outbreak when it comes to receiving vaccination and proper care for said ailment. In my instances people can be ill informed about vaccinations or other forms of treatment for illnesses and have an adverse outlook of them when in reality they are often times just ill-equiped to make a proper judgement due to not having equal access to the information at hand to make their own informed decision.\n",

    "How have COVID-19 vaccination rates and the availability of vaccine doses evolved over time in various regions?\n",

    "What is the relationship between vaccination rates and the incidence of COVID-19 cases in different demographic groups?\n",

    "Are there any patterns or disparities in vaccination rates based on socioeconomic factors or geographic locations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Though not every question above is not the \"Project Question\" itself, they are things to keep in mind that might add to the overall assessment of the issue at hand and provide insights as to why certain trends might be found."

Furthermore, I plan on relation the Socioeconomic Data (Database) to both the vaccine and case data using different regions as a common key to explore any patterns based on socioeconomic factors. \n",

    "My approach to this project is that I will first get all of the data from the various sets imported, merged, and cleaned such that I can begin analyzing it. There are a few different ways that I plan to approach these datasets to analyze the problems at hand. I can potentially perform a time-series analysis using line charts that show vaccination rates & does availability by region over a set amount of time. I can use regression analysis to identify any statistically significant relationships between vaccination rates and COVID-19 case occurrence in terms of different demographic groups and visualize that with scatter plots. Finally, I can use heatmaps to visualize the different vaccine rates based on region and socioeconomic factors.  "
