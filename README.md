### Reflection
<!-- Edit the following section with your reflection -->

#### What went well?
I think I did a good job setting up the information and had an overall good idea with it. I think it was a unique and interesting concept that could have been better executed if it wasn't done last minute.
#### What did not go well?
I don't understand the pipeline stuff and it trickled over to me not getting a good regression model setup. I have been very sick this semester and on top of that worked long and many hours so could not receive help solidifying my understanding of those concepts, so the project ended up falling flat on itself.
#### What did you learn?
A lot more python stuff than I knew before. The only prereq to this class barely taught me anything programming related and since this isn't even my strong suit or what I am interested in, I think it was a big challenge going from the absolute basics with nothing being really taught to this which had many different factors and assumed you were at a strong baseline.
#### What would you do differently next time?
Honestly, take another python class prior to this. As stated the outside factors like being sick and working a lot were out of my control - I can't ultimately control my health and I need to work. I would, however, take another class because I feel like I was grossly ill-prepared for this class with the only previous class barely teaching me any python before this. I think this is something I would revist at a later time, but my main interest is more in SQL and the database side of data technology and not python/other programming.

## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies

To ensure that you have all the dependencies installed, and that we can have a reproducible environment, we will be using `pipenv` to manage our dependencies. `pipenv` is a tool that allows us to create a virtual environment for our project, and install all the dependencies we need for our project. This ensures that we can have a reproducible environment, and that we can all run the same code.

```bash
pipenv install
```

This sets up a virtual environment for our project, and installs the following dependencies:

- `ipykernel`
- `jupyter`
- `notebook`
- `black`
  Throughout your analysis and development, you will need to install additional packages. You can can install any package you need using `pipenv install <package-name>`. For example, if you need to install `numpy`, you can do so by running:

```bash
pipenv install numpy
```

This will update update the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files, and install the package in your virtual environment.
